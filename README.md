# client-sim

![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-success)

`client-sim` contains the spoke-side runtime for the HPE Client-Sim platform. Version **v1.0.0** on `main` is the production release for spoke services, the Proxmox agent, and the shared installer flow:

- the **spoke backend** (`webui-spoke/`)
- the **Proxmox host agent** (`proxmox/`)
- the **Linux simulation scripts** (`linux/`)
- related configs, Windows equivalents, and installer assets

This repo is the local execution plane. It can run standalone, or relay telemetry and commands to Hub. In v1.0 it also carries the Azure-backed VM backup/reseed path used by hub-managed Proxmox environments.

---

## Operators

### What this repo provides

At an operational level, this repo gives you:

- a FastAPI spoke dashboard/API inside a Proxmox LXC
- a Proxmox host agent for VM, USB, USB quarantine, reclone, post-provision retry, and guest-agent watchdog operations
- Linux VM scripts that fetch config, run simulations, and report status
- multi-Proxmox spoke support, with each connected host tracked independently by canonical hostname
- direct Proxmox VNC console workflows exposed through the spoke VM Server
- accurate per-agent Proxmox CPU/memory telemetry with 1-hour rolling averages, warmup estimates, provision-halt state, and hub relay support
- backpressure throttling so sim clients slow down under heavy API/WebSocket load instead of overwhelming the spoke
- watchdogs for both the spoke service and Proxmox agent
- configuration-driven simulation behavior using INI files
- shared hub-style spoke config editors for `simulation.conf` and `user-overrides.conf`
- 7-day client-count baseline monitoring persisted in `client_count_7day.json`
- local spoke auth management with password rotation and extra admin/viewer users

### Spoke installation (`install-lxc.sh`)

#### What the installer does

`install-lxc.sh` is the spoke installer and updater. In the current repo it:

1. validates OS and flags
2. installs system packages
3. auto-detects a second NIC and configures `dnsmasq` DHCP when present
4. clones or updates the `client-sim` repo cache
5. deploys the spoke app files into `/opt/client-sim-dashboard`
6. fetches shared frontend assets from `cs-webui`
7. creates a Python virtual environment and installs `requirements.txt`
8. writes or updates `.env`
9. installs the `client-sim-dashboard` systemd service and web UI watchdog
10. starts or restarts the service

#### Prerequisites

Before you run it, have:

- a Debian or Ubuntu LXC
- root or `sudo` access
- outbound access to GitHub
- a Proxmox-attached second NIC if you want the isolated DHCP network

#### Install commands

The production installer now lives at the repo root and should be fetched from:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/install-lxc.sh
```

Standard install/update:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/install-lxc.sh) --branch main
```

Full wipe/reinstall:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/install-lxc.sh) --reinstall --branch main
```

Custom port example:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/install-lxc.sh) --branch main --port 9000
```

Hub onboarding with tenant PSK auto-approval:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/install-lxc.sh) \
  --hub-url https://hub.example.com:8443 \
  --hub-tenant <tenant-id> \
  --hub-psk <psk>
```

Local checkout usage still works too:

```bash
cd /opt/client-sim-repo
sudo bash install-lxc.sh --branch main
```

#### What to verify after install

```bash
systemctl status client-sim-dashboard
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
cat /var/log/client-sim-dashboard-install.log
```

### Proxmox agent installation (`proxmox/install-proxmox-agent.sh`)

#### What the installer does

The Proxmox agent installer:

1. downloads the latest agent, watchdog, and installer scripts from GitHub
2. installs the systemd service and timer units
3. writes `/etc/client-sim-proxmox-agent.env`
4. installs the VirtualHere USB client, first reusing any existing binary found under root's `~/.local`, `/opt`, or `/home`, symlinking it to `/usr/sbin/vhclient`, rebuilding `virtualhereclient.service` with the real binary path, and clearing any stale `override.conf` on reinstall
5. prepares watchdog state
6. enables and starts the service and watchdog timer
7. checks spoke API reachability

#### Step-by-step install

Run this on the **Proxmox host**, not inside the LXC.

1. Install from GitHub (recommended for production `main`) or from a local checkout.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solutions-hpe/client-sim/main/proxmox/install-proxmox-agent.sh | sudo bash -s -- \
  --server http://169.253.1.1:8000 \
  --branch main \
  --hub-url https://<hub-host>:8443 \
  --tenant-id <tenant-id> \
  --installer-key <installer-api-key>
```

```bash
cd /opt/client-sim-repo/proxmox
sudo bash install-proxmox-agent.sh \
  --server http://169.253.1.1:8000 \
  --branch main \
  --hub-url https://<hub-host>:8443 \
  --tenant-id <tenant-id> \
  --installer-key <installer-api-key>
```

`--hub-url` and `--tenant-id` let the installer seed spoke-to-hub settings through the spoke's localhost-only `/api/bootstrap` endpoint. `--installer-key` is the shared secret Hub expects on `X-Installer-Key` when the installer requests an Azure SAS URL for private blob downloads.

2. Check that the service started.

```bash
systemctl status client-sim-proxmox-agent
systemctl status proxmox-watchdog.timer
journalctl -u client-sim-proxmox-agent -f
```

3. Approve the agent from the spoke UI, or by API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://169.253.1.1:8000/api/proxmox/approve/<hostname>
```

4. Confirm the agent received a key and is posting telemetry.

```bash
cat /etc/client-sim-proxmox-agent.env
curl http://169.253.1.1:8000/api/proxmox/status
```

#### Common installer flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--server <url>` | Required spoke URL used by the Proxmox agent for local API access; supplying it skips the legacy LXC `1001` lookup during install |
| `--hub-url <url>` | Optional Hub URL used for one-time spoke bootstrap and installer SAS requests |
| `--tenant-id <id>` | Optional tenant identifier passed to the spoke bootstrap flow |
| `--installer-key <key>` | Optional shared secret sent as `X-Installer-Key` when requesting the installer SAS token from Hub |
| `--key <api_key>` | Pre-seed an API key instead of waiting for approval |
| `--interval <seconds>` | Override poll interval |
| `--branch <name>` | Branch to pull scripts from (default: `main`) |
| `--unattended` | Automation-friendly mode |
| `--skip-vh` | Skip VirtualHere client installation |

#### Azure VM backup and reseed

In v1.0, the Proxmox agent can receive `backup` and `reseed` commands over its WebSocket client and execute them asynchronously. Operationally:

- `run_backup_command()` creates a `vzdump` snapshot, then uploads the artifact to private Azure Blob Storage in `csvmstorage/vms` with `azcopy`.
- `run_reseed_command()` downloads the selected blob URL, restores the VM with `qmrestore`, converts the template when needed, and reclones VMs.
- Progress is reported back to Hub with `backup_progress` and `reseed_progress` messages so Hub users can watch long-running jobs.
- Installers and restore flows request a short-lived, read-only SAS URL from Hub instead of embedding the raw Azure account key on the Proxmox host.

#### Branch override config

At startup, `install-proxmox-agent.sh` tries to download `proxmox/installer-override.conf` from the selected branch and silently skips it on `404`. When present, that file can override values such as `AZURE_ACCOUNT`, `OVERRIDE_HUB_URL`, `OVERRIDE_TENANT_ID`, and `OVERRIDE_SERVER_URL`.

On production `main`, `installer-override.conf` is intentionally **not** shipped. Production installs will silently skip the override download with no effect.

### Proxmox telemetry, warmup, and recovery

Recent Proxmox-side changes add these operator-visible behaviors:

- **Multi-Proxmox host tracking** — multiple agents can connect to one spoke at the same time, and `webui-spoke/server.py` keeps each host in `proxmox_states` keyed by canonical hostname so cards, drill-down pages, and commands stay scoped to the correct node.
- **Accurate host CPU** — `proxmox-agent.sh` samples `/proc/stat` twice, 1 second apart, and reports `(1 − Δidle / Δtotal) × 100`. This captures total host CPU load (user, nice, system, iowait, irq, softirq), not just top's user-space `%us` value.
- **Per-agent 1-hour CPU and memory averages** — `webui-spoke/server.py` records rolling CPU and memory samples per host and exposes both confirmed 1-hour averages and warmup estimates.
- **Three warmup UI states** — the spoke Details tab and hub Details view show: `📊 warming up… <N> min remaining` when no samples exist yet, `📊 CPU avg: ~3.2% (<N> min remaining)` / `Mem avg: ~…` while the 1-hour window is still filling, and `📊 CPU avg: 3.2%` / `Mem avg: 41.7%` once the full 60-minute window is available.
- **Persisted warmup cache** — `webui-spoke/resource_cache.json` stores `cpu_samples`, `mem_samples`, `started`, `agent_version`, and `pve_version` so a spoke restart does not reset the warmup countdown or blank the Details version rows.
- **Provision halt telemetry + dual CPU gate** — `check_resource_halt()` runs on every main-loop pass, writes a cache entry with `{halted, reason, cpu_pct, cpu_threshold, mem_pct, mem_threshold, ts}`, and feeds the UI halt/throttle badges. Provision pacing now uses both an instantaneous ramp ceiling and an inter-clone pacing ceiling.
- **Delete gate hardening (v1.26–v1.28)** — automatic deletes tear down only the highest VMID when the 1-hour average CPU is at or above the delete threshold (default `90%`), require warmed CPU/memory telemetry before any allow/deny decision, and enforce a 5-minute cooldown after any delete that blocks both further deletes and re-provisioning. Done/failed `prov_run` items also clear stale `provisioning` state automatically.
- **VMID gap audit (v1.28)** — every 5 minutes per host, the agent checks the reported `vmid_range` for gaps in sequential VMID assignment and queues deletion of the highest VMID above the gap to restore order. This repair path intentionally bypasses the normal delete cooldown.
- **Recovery queues and watchdogs** — if a VM misses the post-reboot `update.sh` step because the guest agent is still unavailable, the agent retries every 10 minutes and destroys/reclones the VM after 1 hour. Separately, the VM guest-agent watchdog monitors `qm guest ping`, soft-reboots unresponsive guests, and reclones them if they stay down beyond the configured escalation thresholds.

When relay is enabled, Hub receives per-host `agent_version`, `pve_version`, `cpu_1h_avg`, `mem_1h_avg`, `cpu_est_avg`, `mem_est_avg`, `resource_samples_started`, `vmid_range`, `provision_halt`, and per-VM `cpu` / `mem` / `maxmem` fields through `_build_relay_telemetry_payload()`. The raw sample history itself stays local on the spoke in `resource_cache.json`.

### USB allocation policies

Spoke USB auto-provisioning is configured in **Setup → Proxmox**.

- `sim_phy` now accepts `wireless`, `ethernet`, or `any`.
- `sim_phy=any` allows any certified dongle type to be provisioned, and the Proxmox workflow writes the VM's effective `sim_phy` to match the actual dongle type attached.
- **Use All Available Dongles** lets the spoke or hub overflow to the other certified dongle type when the preferred type is exhausted.
- `protected_vmids` accepts comma-separated VMIDs and inclusive ranges such as `100-90000`; those guests are excluded from UI-driven delete/reclone/start/stop actions, including **Delete All Sim VMs**.
- USB bus quarantine state is carried through spoke and hub telemetry so the bash agent can suppress unstable or unwanted buses without losing visibility.
- The hub tenant setting lives in **Setup → Tenant Setup** and the local spoke override lives in **Setup → Proxmox**.

### VirtualHere auto-use sync

Once the Proxmox agent is approved and polling, it keeps the local VirtualHere client aligned by sending `AUTO USE ALL` over the VirtualHere IPC interface.

**How it works now:**

1. `_find_vhclient()` searches root's `~/.local`, `/opt`, and `/home` recursively before falling back to canonical locations such as `/usr/sbin/vhclient`.
2. `_apply_vh_auto_use()` makes sure `virtualhereclient.service` is pointed at the discovered binary, starts the service if needed, then sends `AUTO USE ALL`.
3. `_sync_vh_auto_use()` runs every agent cycle and only re-applies when the VirtualHere service is not active.
4. There is no client-side VID:PID filtering anymore; device filtering is done on the VirtualHere server side (for example on the QNAP that is sharing devices).

Operationally, this means the spoke-side agent claims every device the VH server exposes, while the VH server remains the source of truth for which devices are actually shared.

To skip VH installation entirely, pass `--skip-vh` to the installer. The auto-use sync is a no-op if `virtualhereclient.service` is not installed.

### Local spoke auth

The spoke now includes **Setup → Account** for local authentication management.

- **Change Password** rotates the primary local `admin` account password.
- **Local Users** lets spoke admins add or remove extra local users with `admin` or `viewer` roles.
- Hub-driven config sync never overwrites spoke auth settings: `admin_password`, `auth_provider`, and all LDAP/RADIUS/TACACS fields remain local-only on the spoke.

### Standalone spoke configuration

When a spoke is running without Hub relay, it manages its own config files locally.

- **Config** tab: edit `simulation.conf` using the shared hub-style renderer. `[simulation]`, `[server]`, `[address]`, and each `s0`–`s9` slot render as collapsible cards with text/select fields in a responsive grid and boolean flags inline.
- **Setup → Simulation**: opens the same `simulation.conf` editor from the Setup workflow.
- **Config → User Overrides**: manage `user-overrides.conf` locally from the spoke UI.

When the spoke is hub-connected, tenant pushes from Hub take precedence and are written locally as `configs/hub-sim-overrides.conf` and `configs/hub-user-overrides.conf`.

### Configuration files

The two main operator-edited files are:

- `configs/simulation.conf`
- `configs/user-overrides.conf`

Operators can edit these directly in GitHub, through Hub when relay-managed, or from the spoke UI when running standalone.

Resolution order on a client VM is:

```text
[simulation] globals
  -> [s0]-[s9] bucket profile selected by zlib.crc32(hostname) % 10
  -> [username] override from user-overrides.conf
  -> usb-phy-override.conf for sim_phy when provisioned by Proxmox agent
```

#### `user-overrides.conf`

`user-overrides.conf` is optional and loaded after `simulation.conf`. Only set keys you want to override.

Example:

```ini
[slynch]
dns_fail=off
ssidpw_fail=on
wsite=DFW
```

### Watchdogs

#### Spoke watchdog

- timer unit: `webui-watchdog.timer`
- service unit: `webui-watchdog.service`
- log file: `/var/log/webui-watchdog.log`
- state counter: `/var/lib/webui-watchdog/state`

Checks:

```bash
systemctl status webui-watchdog.timer
systemctl status webui-watchdog.service
cat /var/log/webui-watchdog.log
```

Behavior:

- failure 1: log only
- failure 2: restart `client-sim-dashboard`
- failure 5+: rerun `install-lxc.sh --unattended`

#### Proxmox watchdog

- timer unit: `proxmox-watchdog.timer`
- service unit: `proxmox-watchdog.service`
- log file: `/var/log/proxmox-watchdog.log`
- state counter: `/var/lib/proxmox-watchdog/state`

Checks:

```bash
systemctl status proxmox-watchdog.timer
systemctl status proxmox-watchdog.service
cat /var/log/proxmox-watchdog.log
```

Behavior:

- every 5 minutes, independently checks `virtualhereclient.service`; if it is not active, restarts it and reports a `vh_restart` event to the spoke API
- failure 1: log/report failure
- failure 2: restart `client-sim-proxmox-agent`
- failure 5+: rerun the Proxmox agent installer

The VirtualHere restart path is separate from the Proxmox agent failure counter.

### Spoke WebUI and operator-useful API endpoints

#### Health and status

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/services/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/system/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/version
```

#### Client and config views

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/clients
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/config?hostname=<client-hostname>"
curl http://localhost:8000/api/config/overrides
curl http://localhost:8000/api/config/parsed
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scripts/list?platform=linux"
```

#### Proxmox views

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/pending
curl http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/approved
curl http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/reclone-status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/usb-config
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/proxmox/console/<vmid>
```

`POST /api/proxmox/console/{vmid}` creates a direct Proxmox VNC console session for the spoke VM Server view; the browser then opens `/console?session_id=<id>` and bridges over `WS /ws/console/{session_id}`.

#### Relay and repo views

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/repo/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/relay/status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/relay/diag
```

#### Logs and maintenance

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/logs/history?lines=200&source=service"
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sync-now
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/self-update
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/update-all
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to check | Typical fix |
|---|---|---|
| Spoke UI is down | `systemctl status client-sim-dashboard` and `/api/health` | rerun `install-lxc.sh`, inspect `/var/log/client-sim-dashboard-install.log`, check watchdog log |
| Clients are not appearing | `curl /api/health`, `curl /api/clients`, client `server_url` | verify `server_url`, `web_server=on`, and client reachability to `169.253.1.1:8000` |
| Proxmox agent never connects | `systemctl status client-sim-proxmox-agent`, `curl /api/proxmox/pending` | approve the pending host, verify `/etc/client-sim-proxmox-agent.env`, then restart the agent |
| VM Server tab is empty | `curl /api/proxmox/status` | make sure the Proxmox agent is approved and posting telemetry |
| Commands stay queued | `curl /api/commands`, agent/client logs | confirm agent or client can poll `/api/inbox` and POST `/api/inbox/ack` |

### `webui-spoke/server.py` architecture

#### Core responsibilities

`server.py` is the spoke control plane. It handles:

- serving the shared UI in `WEBUI_MODE=spoke`
- receiving VM status beacons
- exposing config and script download endpoints
- managing client and Proxmox command queues
- polling Aruba Central
- relaying telemetry to Hub when enabled
- tracking updates, reclones, VM watchdog state, and service logs
- serving `VERSION`/`INSTALLER_VERSION` data to the UI and cache-busting `app.js`/`style.css` with `?v=<app_version>`
- broadcasting real-time state over `/ws`

#### Background tasks

The FastAPI lifespan boot starts these tasks:

- `sync_repo`
- `heartbeat_check`
- `central_token_manager`
- `central_poller`
- `check_for_update`
- `relay_loop`
- `client_history_saver`
- `expire_commands`
- `auto_recovery_check`
- `vm_watchdog_loop`
- `schedule_check`
- `gkill_switch_poller`
- `hourly_baseline_saver`
- `acme_renewal_loop`

#### Important persisted state

| File | Why it exists |
|---|---|
| `settings.json` | durable settings and approved keys |
| `state_cache.json` | restart recovery for last-known proxmox/central state |
| `command_queue.json` | local queued commands, persisted asynchronously for restart recovery |
| `reclone_state.json` | long-running VM operation state, persisted asynchronously |
| `relay_state.json` | hub relay connection state |
| `update_state.json` | installer/app update status |
| `vm_watchdog.json` | VM guest-agent watchdog / auto-recovery state, persisted asynchronously |
| `resource_cache.json` | rolling CPU/memory samples plus cached `agent_version` / `pve_version` for 1-hour warmup recovery |
| `central_history.jsonl` | Central alert history |
| `client_history.json` | client history persistence |
| `client_count_7day.json` | persisted 7-day hourly client-count history used for the baseline alarm |

#### Main in-memory state families

- `clients`
- `proxmox_states` (one entry per connected Proxmox host, keyed by canonical hostname)
- `central_status`
- `central_wireless_clients`
- `relay_state`
- `update_state`
- approved/pending Proxmox agent maps
- WebSocket connection list

### Proxmox agent architecture

#### What the agent owns

`proxmox/proxmox-agent.sh` runs on the Proxmox host and owns:

- host registration and API key persistence
- USB certification, quarantine, and assignment tracking
- VM inventory, node telemetry collection, and host `agent_version` / `pve_version` / `vmid_range` reporting
- VM provisioning, recloning, deletion, post-provision retry handling, and updates
- provision-halt caching, delete-gate enforcement, and VMID gap-audit repair logic
- VM guest-agent watchdog health / reboot / reclone escalation
- command polling/ACK handling, including non-blocking `delete_vm` ACKs
- self-update scheduling

#### State file format

The agent writes `/etc/client-sim-usb-state.conf` as tab-delimited lines:

```text
<vmid>	<bus_path>	<missing_since>	<image_num>	<vidpid>
```

That file is reloaded on every agent restart to reconstruct USB-to-VM mappings.

#### Runtime loops

- background telemetry sender every `TELEMETRY_INTERVAL`
- background inbox processor every `INBOX_INTERVAL`
- USB scan/provision loop in the main process
- unconditional `check_resource_halt()` evaluation on every loop iteration
- post-provision retry queue sweep for VMs that missed the post-reboot step
- VMID gap audit every 5 minutes per host
- VM guest-agent watchdog sweep using the configured grace/check/reboot/reclone timers
- periodic self-update check

#### USB tracking model

- certified devices come from spoke `/api/proxmox/usb-config`
- unknown devices are surfaced separately for operator review
- missing USB devices retain state until timeout
- `usb-phy-override.conf` is written inside guests so `sim_phy` matches the assigned USB class

The agent also keeps three durable per-VM marker files in its provision state directory:

- `.post_prov_retry` — VM completed the clone but missed the post-reboot `update.sh` step; retry every 10 minutes, reclone after 1 hour
- `.provision_done` — anchor timestamp for the guest-agent watchdog grace period
- `.agent_unresponsive` — watchdog escalation state (`first_fail`, `last_check`, `rebooted_at`)

### Simulation script architecture

#### Startup chain

```text
startup.sh
  -> sources ini-parser.sh
  -> loads simulation.conf and user-overrides.conf
  -> runs update.sh
  -> starts helper services
  -> launches simulation.sh
```

#### Main loop

`simulation.sh`:

- re-parses config on each exec restart
- writes its local runtime log to `/tmp/sim.log` so the LXDE autologin user always has a writable log target
- fetches global kill switch live
- runs up to 100 iterations per cycle
- posts status/errors to `/api/status`
- triggers `update.sh` in rapid-update mode or at restart boundaries
- optionally goes offline between cycles when `allow_offline=on`
- finishes by `exec bash /usr/local/scripts/simulation.sh`

#### Kill switch behavior

- local `kill_switch` comes from `simulation.conf`
- global kill switch is fetched live from spoke `/api/kill-switch`, then upstream GitHub fallback
- if either is `on`, the script parks and waits for restart/reload

#### `SIGUSR1` restart model

`simulation.sh` installs a `USR1` trap that sets a restart flag.

`agent.sh` uses that for:

- `restart_sim`
- `kill_switch`

That avoids hard-killing the process and lets the VM loop exit cleanly into its normal exec-restart path.

On Linux clients, the websocket agent is intended to run under `client-sim-agent.service` and publish heartbeat data to `/var/lib/client-sim/agent-health.json`. `client-sim-watchdog.timer` runs `sys_mon.sh --check-once` every minute so a crashed, zombie, or stale agent is restarted even if the websocket process stops updating its health file.

### Adding a new inbox/agent command

#### VM-side command (`linux/agent.sh`)

1. Add the command producer in the spoke or hub.
2. Ensure it is returned by `/api/inbox`.
3. Add a new `case` branch in `linux/agent.sh`.
4. Perform the local action.
5. POST the result to `/api/inbox/ack`.

#### Proxmox-side command (`proxmox/proxmox-agent.sh`)

1. Add the command producer in the spoke or hub.
2. Teach `process_inbox()` / `execute_vm_command()` how to recognize it.
3. Implement the host action with `qm`, `pct`, or helper functions.
4. ACK success/failure back to the spoke.
5. Refresh telemetry if the command changes host or VM state.

## Summary

`client-sim` is the local execution engine of the platform: it installs and runs the spoke, manages Proxmox automation, distributes configs/scripts to clients, and drives the simulations themselves.
